# Real Estate Deal Analyzer Chrome Extension  

## **Overview**  
Build a Google Chrome extension that automatically extracts property details from real estate listing websites and calculates key investment metrics in real time. The extension will help real estate investors, agents, and buyers analyze both **residential and commercial** real estate deals quickly without manual calculations.  

## **Core Functionalities**  
- **Automated Property Data Extraction:** Scrape property details (price, square footage, taxes, HOA fees, rental estimates, lease terms, tenant occupancy, etc.) from listing sites like Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, LoopNet, and CoStar.  
- **Investment Metrics Calculation:** Compute key financial indicators based on the property type:  
  - **Residential:** Cap Rate, Cash-on-Cash Return, Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM), Net Operating Income (NOI), Internal Rate of Return (IRR).  
  - **Commercial:** Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), Gross Lease vs. Triple Net (NNN) Comparison, Vacancy Rate Analysis, Break-Even Occupancy Rate.  
- **Mortgage & Financing Calculator:** Allow users to input loan details (down payment, interest rate, loan term) and calculate monthly mortgage payments, cash flow projections, and commercial loan terms (LTV, amortization).  
- **Comparable Sales & Rental Comps:** Fetch and display recent sales and rental data for both residential and commercial properties.  
- **AI-Powered Property Score:** Assign a property score based on appreciation trends, rental demand, tenant stability, and local economic factors.  
- **Risk Analysis & Red Flags:** Highlight potential risks such as flood zones, high crime areas, zoning restrictions, lease instability, and economic downturn risk.  
- **Export & Integration:** Enable users to export deal reports as PDFs or CSVs and integrate with CRM or property management software.  
- **User Dashboard & Deal Tracking:** Store and compare analyzed properties for future reference, with separate dashboards for residential and commercial properties.  

## **Potential Enhancements**  
1. **AI-Powered Market Forecasting** – Integrate machine learning models to predict future property appreciation and rental trends based on historical data and macroeconomic indicators.  
2. **Real-Time Interest Rate Updates** – Fetch live mortgage and commercial lending interest rates from financial APIs to provide accurate financing projections.  
3. **Collaboration Features** – Allow users to share deal reports with partners, clients, or teams with built-in commenting and collaboration tools for joint investment analysis.  

## **Technical Requirements**  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React for UI preferred)  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js (if needed for API calls)  
- **Data Extraction:** JavaScript DOM manipulation + Cheerio.js or Puppeteer for scraping  
- **Storage:** LocalStorage for saving user data, Firebase or Supabase for cloud syncing (optional)  
- **APIs:** Zillow API, Realtor.com API, LoopNet API, CoStar API, Google Maps API (for location data), OpenAI API (for AI-based property scoring), Mortgage Rate APIs  
- **Security & Permissions:** Requires permissions for `activeTab`, `storage`, and `tabs`  

## **User Flow**  
1. User installs and pins the Chrome extension.  
2. They navigate to a residential or commercial real estate listing site.  
3. Clicking the extension extracts property data and displays key investment metrics.  
4. User customizes financing inputs (down payment, interest rate, etc.).  
5. The extension fetches comps, assigns a property score, and highlights risks.  
6. User can export the analysis as a PDF/CSV or save it for later.  

## **Next Steps**  
1. Develop a minimal viable product (MVP) focusing on property data extraction and investment calculations.  
2. Add AI-powered property scoring and risk analysis for both residential and commercial properties.  
3. Implement a deal tracking dashboard with separate views for residential and commercial real estate.  
4. Release a beta version and gather user feedback.  

## **Notes**  
- Ensure the UI dynamically adjusts based on the property type (residential vs. commercial).  
- Optimize data scraping to avoid website blocking and ensure compliance with site policies.  
- Future enhancements may include AI-driven market forecasting and team collaboration features.
